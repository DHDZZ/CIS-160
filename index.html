    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello my name is Daniel Hernandez I am 21 years old and currently attend cerritos college. I am the youngest child out of two older brothers. Both my parents were born In mexico and have come to the United States at a young age giving me and my siblings a better opportunity and future. I have been a full time student at Cerritos College for the past 3 years. This is currently my last semester here, in hopes to obtain my AA in comp sci. I plan to transfer to a CSU this upcoming fall semester and obtain my bachelors in Computer Science. During my time here in Cerritos I've learned many coding languages but have never tried anything related to web devlopment, like using HTML, CSS or Java script.</p>
