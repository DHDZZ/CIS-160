<header><h2>Guanajuato</h2></header>

<p>The following image is a picture that was taken
    during my trip to Guanajuato Mexico in January 2022.
    Both my parents are from this part of Mexico
    which is why Guanajuato is very special for me
    and a priviledge to travel to. I frequently travel
    here every time im given vacation from school which
    makes it very relaxing to visit and explore.</p>    

<header><h2>Future Trips</h2></header>
<p>I definetly have some future trips in mind, but as of 
    right now due to the pandemic and the increase
    of Covid I may have to put my traveling plans 
    in a hold.</p>
